(2) Use ranking metrics like AUC that are robust to imbalance instead of accuracy.

(2) Use point-in-time feature snapshots for historical features. (3) For user history features, ensure they don't include the current event. (4) Audit features by checking correlation with label—suspiciously high correlation suggests leakage.

(2) Feature joins—joining user features to impression logs at scale requires distributed systems, and stale joins introduce training-serving skew. (3) Label delays—waiting 7 days for labels means training data is always stale, model can't adapt to trends. (4) Negative sampling—with millions of items, can't enumerate all negatives, sampling strategy significantly affects model behavior.
